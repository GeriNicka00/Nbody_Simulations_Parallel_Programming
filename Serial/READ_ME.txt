Instructions to run the serial simulations and validate they describe a real physical system.

1) Run Nbody_Serial_Sim.py

ATTENTION:

A file in the same directory as Nbody_Serial_Sim.py will be created named: Nbody_Serial_Run.
This script is dependent on Nbody_Initialisation.py which is given in the same directory. 
PLEASE DO NOT MOVE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

2) Run Plotter_Script.py

ATTENTION: 

This script will create all required figures at the press of a button.
PLEASE MAKE SURE Nbody_Serial_Sim.py and Plotter_Script.py are in the same directory.
The Nbody_Serial_Run folder with the data will be created in the same directory by default.
